/* Notes:
		i) View are kind of virtual tables, which is not stored.
		ii) To Often use some Query again and again there comes in handy which is 'VIEW' Clause
		iii)Since views are not ordinary tables, you may not be able to execute a DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement on a view
		iv)When you create a view, you basically create a query and assign a name to the query
